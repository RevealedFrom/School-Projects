<p id="AboutMe">
Greetings and thank you for stumbling onto my page! My name is Adam Szablya. They say a picture is worth a thousand words. See the picture above, that is me! This picture was taken by a good friend who goes by the name Niko Stolp-Smith. In my oppinion he captured me at my best. Despite what this picture may say to you about me im a really relaxed individual who likes to have a good time. I built this website to reflect that. Listed below are some of my hobbies. You have proabably notice that my website is a very simple design. This is becaue I designed this wbsite to reflect my pesonality. Cheerfull and and peppy but minimalistic. Hope you enjoy browsing my website!
